### 🌱 Current Interests  
I’m always learning and exploring new technologies. Right now, I’m diving deeper into **machine learning**, **cloud-native architectures**, and **blockchain development**. I believe the best developers are lifelong learners, and I’m committed to staying on the cutting edge of tech.  

### 💡 My Approach to Development  
- **Simplicity**: I believe in writing code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend.  
- **Collaboration**: I thrive in team environments and value clear communication and shared ownership.  
- **Iteration**: I’m a big fan of agile methodologies and iterative development. Small, frequent updates lead to better outcomes.  
- **Quality**: I prioritize clean, tested, and well-documented code over quick fixes.
